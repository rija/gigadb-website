Dear {{ author }},

A new filedrop account has been created on our server to allow the uploading of assets associated with the manuscript you have submitted:

{{ title }}

To upload the assets simply navigate to "Submitted dataset" tab of your user profile after loggging on gigadb.org with your registered credentials: There will be an upload button next the dataset you have submitted.

That's the preferred approach. However you can alternatively use FTP to upload file using the connection details below:


host: {{ ftpd_endpoint }}
port: {{ ftpd_port }}
username: {{ upload_login }}
password: {{ upload_token }}

Example usage:

$ ncftpput -u $username -P <?= {{ ftpd_port }} ?> -p token <?=  {{ ftpd_endpoint }} ?> / some_local_file
my_data.csv:                         119.83 kB  159.64 kB/s


Once you have finished the uploading the files and the metadata.
You can change the status from {{ status }} to "DataAvalaibleForReview" to allow review of the submission and its dataset.

Any question, don't hesitate to contact us at info@gigasciencejournal.com
